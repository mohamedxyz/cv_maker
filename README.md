# open source!
this project is open source and was written by a programer that basicly knows nothing.
if you want to start leveling app and contribute to open source software then start with this.
you won't write a bad code more than I do but you will have an idea on collaboration in teams if you worked in a company.
so clone it and get going
# TODO list
